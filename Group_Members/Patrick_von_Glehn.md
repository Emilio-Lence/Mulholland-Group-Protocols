My research interests lie in understanding the reaction mechanisms and physical basis for catalysis in enzymes.

I am currently engaged in a collaborative project with the experimental group of [Neil Marsh](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/the-marsh-lab/) at the University of Michigan studying the vitamin B12 dependent enzyme glutamate mutase.

We are trying to understand how glutamate mutase and related vitamin B12 dependent enzymes generate and control highly reactive radical species during turnover with a high degree of specificity and selectivity that is typical of enzyme reactions but not of radical reactions in general.

During my undergraduate studies, also at the University of Bristol I was involved in a project studying the reaction mechanisms of the haem dioxygenase family of enzymes, an area in which I have maintained an interest.

The tools that I have used in the course of my research include molecular dynamics, hybrid quantum  mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM), high level quantum mechanics only methods and empirical valence bond simulations (EVB).
